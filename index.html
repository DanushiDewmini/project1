                <strong><abbr title="japan foods">Japanese food</abbr></strong> is known for its unique flavors, beautiful presentation, and healthy ingredients. One of
                the most popular dishes is sushi, which consists of vinegared rice paired with a variety of fish,
                vegetables, and sometimes fruits. Sushi can be eaten in different forms, such as nigiri, which is a
                slice of fish on a small mound of rice, or maki, which is rolled sushi wrapped in seaweed. Another
                beloved dish is ramen, a comforting noodle soup that comes in many regional varieties. Each type of
                ramen has its own broth, which can be rich and meaty or light and refreshing. Japanese cuisine also
                features tempura, lightly battered and fried vegetables or seafood, which is crunchy on the outside and
                tender on the inside.
